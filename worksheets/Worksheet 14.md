# Worksheet 14

1. Write a program in C that reads two strings and appends the first string to the second. For example, if the first string is entered as **Good** and second as **Morning**, the program should print **MorningGood**.
2. Write a program in C that reads a password and prints "OK" if the correct password in entered, otherwise print "Sorry!". The user should be given three chances to type the password.
3. Write a program in C that reads two strings and copies the smaller string into bigger string.
4. Write a program in C that reads three strings and prints the longest and smallest string.
5. Write a program that reads a string and a character. Each occurrence of the given character (regardless of its case) is converted to opposite case. For example, if the string entered is : AabrAcadabrA and the character as A or a then the output string should be aAbracAdAbra. See each a or A is converted to opposite case i.e., upper to lower or vice-versa.

8. Write a function in C to take an **int** argument and return `0`  if the given number is prime otherwise return `-1`.
9. Write a function in C to receive an **int** array, its size and a character `'+'` or `'-'`. By default, the character should be `'+'`. For the character `'+'`, the function returns the sum of positive numbers stored in the array and for the character `'-'`, the function returns the sum of negative numbers stored in the array.
10. Write a function in C that takes a character argument and prints it number of times equal to n umber of times that function has been called to point.
