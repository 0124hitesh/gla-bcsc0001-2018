1. Write a program in C to accept the four sides of a rectangle. Write a program to find out whether its area is greater than its perimeter.

2. Write a program in C to print the series ![](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$$1,4,7,10,...,40$$).

3. Write a program in C to print the series ![](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$$1,-4,7,10,...,-40$$).

4. Write a program in C to calculate the volume and area of a sphere. ![](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$$volume=\frac{4}{3}\pi\,r\,^3\,and\,area=4\,\pi\,r^2$$)

5. A bank accepts fixed deposits for one year or more and the policy it adopts on interest is as follows:

   1. If a deposit is less than Rs. 2000 and for 2 or more years, the interest rate is 5% compounded annually.
   2. If a deposit is Rs. 2000 or more but less than 6000 and for 2 or more years, the interest rate is 7% compounded annually.
   3. If a deposit is more than Rs. 6000 and is for 1 year or more, the interest is 8% compounded annually.
   4. On all deposits for 5 years or more, interest is 10 % compounded annually.
   5. On all other deposits not covered by above conditions, the interest is 3% compounded annually.

   Given the amount deposited and the number of years, write a program in C to calculate the money in the customer's account at the end of the specified time.

6. Write a program in C to do the following

   1. read an integer `X`
   2. form an integer `Y` by reversing the digits of `X` and integer `S` by having sum of digits of `X`
   3. output `Y` and `S`

   *(for example, if `X = 5076`, then `Y` should be able to `6705` and `S` should be `18`)*

7. Write a program in C to output the truth table of `X & Y`.

8. Write a program in C to print every integer between 1 and `n` divisible by `m`. Also, report the number that whether the divisible number is either even or odd.

   1. 26-35
   2. 36-45
   3. 46-55

10. Write a program in C to find the sum of the series ![](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$$S=1+x+x^2+x^3+...+x^n$$).
