# Worksheet 13

1. Write a program in C to print the cube of a given number using a function.
2. Write a program in C to swap two variables (using function using call by value).
3. Write a program in C to swap two variables (using function using call by reference).
4. Write a program in C to convert distance in feet or inches using call by reference.
5. Write a program in C to check whether a given character is contained in a string or not. If found, also print its position.
6. Write a function in C name **op()** with three argument, two integers and one character. The function will operate on the two integers values based upon the operation defined by the character and print the result.
7. Write a program in C that takes a `double` array name and an array size as arguments and that swaps the first and last value in that array.
8. Write a function in C that takes three arguments : the name of a `float` array, the array size, and a `float` value. Have the function set each element of the array to `float` value.
9. Write a function in C that takes an `int` argument and doubles it. The function does not return a value.
10. Write a function in C that takes two `char` arguments and returns `0` if both the arguments are equal. The function returns `-1` if the first argument is smaller than the second and `1` if the second argument is smaller than the first.
